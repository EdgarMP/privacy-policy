<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<h4>
Last updated: June 1, 2018
<h4>
<p>Apptegy Inc. (“Apptegy”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) develops and operates customized online solutions such as websites and mobile applications (the “Services”), for schools, school districts, and other community organizations (our “Customers”).  This Privacy Policy describes Apptegy’s collection, use and disclosure of the information of users who access the Services.
   Like the organizations we serve, we are sensitive about the collection and use of data from users (“Users,” “you,” or “your”) who visit the websites or download the apps we have built for our Customers.  It is our pledge that we do not collect personally-identifiable information from you through the Services. <br>
   If you are concerned that your information has been collected or shared without your permission, please notify the Customer for whom the website or mobile application was built.  You may also contact us at the address provided below.
</p>
<h4>Personally identifiable information</h4>
<p>Apptegy Inc. will never ask Users of the Services to provide personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address and phone number (“Personal Information”). </p>
<h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>
<p>The Services are not intended for use by children under 13 without parental supervision.  If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from children under 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.  <br>
   If you suspect that information from a child has been inappropriately collected or handled through the Services, please contact our data protection officer at <a href="mailto:josiah@apptegy.com">josiah@apptegy.com</a>.  Children under 18 may request removal of content or Personal Information that has been posted on the Services.
</p>
<h4>Log Data</h4>
<p>Some sites and services collect identifying information that your browser sends whenever you visit a particular page (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Services that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.  Apptegy Inc. collects Log Data from Users of the Services [only in anonymized formats].  We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Services, to provide Customers with information about the use of the Services, to improve the Services, and to perform internal operations such as troubleshooting, testing, and analyzing usage.  Be aware, however, that if you navigate away from the Services to another site or application (including our own apptegy.com website), different policies may apply.</p>
<h4>Links To Other Sites</h4>
<p>The Services may contain links to external sites and services. For example, an organization might conduct fundraising or ask for volunteers, and you might navigate links from our Services to external sites and services that are not subject to this Privacy Policy.  We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.
   <br> We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
</p>
<p class="thrill">In addition to our customized website and mobile application Services, Apptegy offers Thrillshare, a communications tool that manages online interactions across web, mobile, social media, and alerts.  Our Customers sometimes choose to integrate the Services with Thrillshare communications, or feeds.  However, the Services described in, and subject to, this Privacy Policy are available to the public, and we do not use the Services to access or use individual contact information, for example phone numbers or email addresses.  When Customers use Thrillshare to communicate directly with individuals, our collection of any individual contact information from those Customers is subject to our Thrillshare Privacy Policy.  </p>
<h4>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
<p>By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 1, 2018 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page. <br>
   We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Site after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. <br>
   If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our website.
